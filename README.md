## What I learned

As a person who is new to react , I learned lots of new stuff 🤯. Some of them include:

- Working with forms
- New ES6 functions
- Data validation
- Sending requests with tokens
- better understanding of react hooks

## What I will learn

I am aware my code isn't perfect 😅 and I think there is a lot of room to grow. <br>
After working with dozens of states I realized the importance of state management libraries such as redux which can improve quality and readability of our code. <br>
Therefore, `redux` becomes the most important technology to learn on my radar 🧐
